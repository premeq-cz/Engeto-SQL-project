# SQL project for Engeto Academy

The goal of this project is to answer 5 questions related to data set provided by Engeto Academy.
The available data is on food prices and wages.

The task was to create two tables, one for data on prices and wages in a certain pariod, the other for European countries with GDP and GINI coefficient.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of _joining_ two or more tables, usage of _agregate functions_ and utilizing basic _Common Table Expressions_.

The 5 questions to answer are:
1. Do wages increase across all sectors over the years, or do they decline in some?
2. How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available data on prices and wages?
3. Which category of food is increasing in price the slowest (has the lowest year-over-year percentage increase)?
4. Is there a year in which the year-over-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than the increase in wages (greater than 10%)?
5. Má výška HDP vliv na změny ve mzdách a cenách potravin? Neboli, pokud HDP vzroste výrazněji v jednom roce, projeví se to na cenách potravin či mzdách ve stejném nebo násdujícím roce výraznějším růstem?


## Structure of this repository

__SQL scripts__ are provided for each question and each table individually for easier navigation.

__PDF files__ contain answers for the questions, one is in Czech and the other in English.
